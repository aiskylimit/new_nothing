results/ is gitignored, so on a fresh host no completion markers arrive with the repo and
nothing is skipped: a bare \`bash run.sh\` would retrain MAVEN perm0-1 as well. Either copy
the old host's results/ over first, or keep MISSING_PLAN narrowed as above. run.sh's header
has the rest, including GPU_DIST_ALL / GPU_CLLORA_ALL when gpu0+gpu1 are not the free pair.

Collect afterwards:  python tools/ced_collect.py --host-label <label> [--upload]
